HW -03 UNIX DATA WRANGLING
In this assignment i used grep to filter mistery related reviews from the Amazon folder as well as using heads and tails to preserve the header and sample.
Moreover I used cut to extract specific required columns to organize the data.
In the star rating distribution it suggest that 5 star reviews dominated the dataset indicating a strong positive presence in its reviews.
